# Auto hot-reload runner for Flutter on Android emulator (macOS friendly).
# - Boots emulator if needed
# - Runs `flutter run` and captures its PID
# - Watches for changes in lib/ and pubspec.yaml and sends SIGUSR1 (hot reload)
#
# Usage:
#   tools/run_android_autoreload.sh [AVD_NAME]
#
# Notes:
# - SIGUSR1 triggers hot reload, SIGUSR2 would trigger hot restart.
# - This uses a portable polling-based watcher (no extra brew deps).
